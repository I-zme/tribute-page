# tribute-page

This is a tribute page for Brian May

Project for FreeCodeCamp certification

managed:

- full page styling, expands when necessary
- scrollbar hidden but functional
- responsive to _computer_ screen changes
- added several images with calc width

=> will make some changes for the FCC code, since some things cannot be entered there (such as images), but no major script changes.
